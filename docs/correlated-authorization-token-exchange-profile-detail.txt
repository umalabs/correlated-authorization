note over AS-RqP:AS-RqP:\n• supports the token exchange extension of OAuth2 as an STS service\n• publishes its metadata on a URL /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server\n• also acts as RqP's Identity Provider
note over Client:Client:\n• is registered at AS-RqP as a public or confidential client\n• acts as a Relying Party in respect of the RqP's Identity Provider in order to obtain an access_token_with_user_claims\n• is registered at AS-RO as a public or confidential client\n• acts as a token forwarder that forwards tokens between the RS and STS, and between the STS and AS-RO
note over RS:RO has set up the RS, registers the resources at the AS-RO and sets policies
RS<-Client:1. Send HTTP request to the resource_uri with no access token
RS->AS-RO:2. Request a permission_ticket and resource_claims_token\n{PAT}
note over AS-RO: AS-RO generates the permission_ticket (a JWT with a random NONCE value in the sub claim)\nand the resource_claims_token which is bound to the permission_ticket through the permission_ticket sub claim hash.\nThe resource_claims_token contains these claims:\n{iss, aud, sub, exp, nbf}\niss is the URI that identifies who issues the resource_claims_token\naud is the URI that identifies the requested resource\nsub is the permission_ticket sub claim hash computed as Base64URL-Encode(SHA256(permission_ticket{sub})\nexp, nbf are the standard JWT claims)
RS<-AS-RO:3. Return the permission_ticket, resource_claims_token,\n    issued_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt
RS->Client:4. Return 401 with the permission_ticket, resource_claims_token,\n    issued_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt
AS-RqP<-Client:5. Request an identity_claims_token (token exchange request)\n    {grant_type = token-exchange,\n     requested_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt,\n     subject_token = access_token_with_user_claims,\n     subject_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token,\n     actor_token = resource_claims_token,\n     actor_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt}
group Authorization assessment – evaluate the resource provenance / ownership
note over AS-RqP:1. verify the subject_token signature\n2. evaluate the subject_token claims\n3. verify the resource_claims_token signature\n4. evaluate the resource claims 
end
note over AS-RqP:AS-RqP generates the identity_claims_token with these claims:\n{iss, aud, sub, exp, nbf, act{sub}}\niss is the URI that identifies who issues the identity_claims_token\naud identifies the target service and it is the iss claim value extracted from the resource_claims_token\nsub identifies the principal by email address and was extracted from the access_token_with_user_claims\nexp, nbf are the standard JWT claims\nact{sub} is the sub value extracted from the resource_claims_token
Client<-AS-RqP:6. Return the identity_claims_token in the access_token parameter,\n    issued_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt

Client->AS-RO:7. Request an access_token (token exchange request)\n    {grant_type = token-exchange,\n     requested_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token,\n     subject_token = permission_ticket,\n     subject_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt,\n     actor_token = identity_claims_token,\n     actor_token_type = urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt}
group Authorization assessment – evaluate the RqP identity provenance / ownership
note over AS-RO:1. verify the permission ticket signature\n2. evaluate the permission_ticket claims\n3. verify the identity_claims_token signature\n4. evaluate the identity claims\n5. compare identity_claims_token{act{sub}} vs. Base64URL-Encode(SHA256(permission_ticket{sub}))
end
note over AS-RO:AS-RO generates the access_token with these additional claims:\n{act{sub}}\nact{sub} is the sub value extracted from identity_claims_token
Client<-AS-RO:8. Return the access_token, optionally a refresh_token
RS<-Client:9. Send HTTP request to resource_uri\n    {access_token}
RS->Client:10. Return HTTP response, typically with 200, 201 status code
